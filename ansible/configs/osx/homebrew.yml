## The path where Homebrew will be installed (homebrew_prefix is the parent directory). It is recommended you
##  stick to the default, otherwise Homebrew might have some weird issues. If you change this variable, you should
##  also manually create a symlink back to /usr/local so things work as Homebrew expects.
#homebrew_prefix: /usr/local
#homebrew_install_path: "{{ homebrew_prefix }}/Homebrew"

## The path where brew will be installed.
#homebrew_brew_bin_path: /usr/local/bin
