# (Any commented value is default)

## The GitHub repository for Homebrew core.
#homebrew_repo: https://github.com/Homebrew/brew

## The path where Homebrew will be installed (homebrew_prefix is the parent directory). It is recommended you
##  stick to the default, otherwise Homebrew might have some weird issues. If you change this variable, you should
##  also manually create a symlink back to /usr/local so things work as Homebrew expects.
#homebrew_prefix: /usr/local
#homebrew_install_path: "{{ homebrew_prefix }}/Homebrew"

## The path where brew will be installed.
#homebrew_brew_bin_path: /usr/local/bin

## Packages you would like to make sure are installed via brew install. You can optionally add flags to the install
##  by setting an install_options property, and if used, you need to explicitly set the name for the package as well.

  # Install GNU core utilities (those that come with OS X are outdated).
  # Don’t forget to add `$(brew --prefix coreutils)/libexec/gnubin` to `$PATH`.

## Taps you would like to make sure Homebrew has tapped.
